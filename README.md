# Notes

## Development
    [1] Server      npm run server-dev
                    http://localhost:3001
                    http://localhost:3001/api

    [2] React-App   npm run react-dev
                    http://localhost:3000

    (May want to run both if hitting API from FE)

## Deployment
    In order:

    [1] React-App   npm run react-build 

    [2] Server      npm run server-start
                    http://localhost:3001
                    http://localhost:3001/api

    (Can now hit web-app and API!)
